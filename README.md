## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
1. Example App: Google Maps
	•	Real-time traffic updates
	•	Nearby business and place reviews
	•	Offline maps feature

2. I’d love to build an app called "CodeCircle", a fun space where beginner and intermediate coders can team up, chat, and build small projects together while learning from each other in real time.
## Notes

Challenges faced was connecting UI to logic but it turned out to be really interesting and magical like making my own app to tap a button which shuffles the background colors
